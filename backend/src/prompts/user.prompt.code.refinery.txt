Below are the three knowledge parts for you to understand:

<<CORE_GUIDE>>
(contains global rules and available APIs)

<<TOPICAL_RULES>>
(contains detailed lists of functions, parameters, variable paths, and naming patterns)

<<EXAMPLES_PLAYBOOK>>

User query (process description):
{{USER_QUERY}}

Your task:
1. Read and understand the three knowledge parts.
2. Choose only the parts that help you implement the process described above (you can ignore irrelevant details).
3. Using your understanding, generate a single JavaScript code block that correctly performs the described logic, making reasonable assumptions if needed.
4. Add brief comments to explain what the code does.

Output only the JavaScript code.
