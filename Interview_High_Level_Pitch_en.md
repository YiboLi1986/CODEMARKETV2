# ✅ **英文版 — Interview High-Level Pitch**

If you ask me to summarize this project in one minute:

> This is an AI-assisted automation system designed for petrochemical process control.
>
> The goal is to let **entry-level engineers** build **safe and compliant** control logic for industrial equipment  **without coding** , simply through natural-language interaction.

How does it work?

1️⃣ We maintain an **Industrial Rule Engine**

— a curated knowledge base including validated control modules, safety constraints, interlocks, limits, and startup/shutdown sequencing.

2️⃣ The user just describes a control intention

like:

“Maintain tank level 70%, open V2 if high, trip pump if critically high.”

3️⃣ Copilot Business Model API generates the JS control logic

— including necessary validations, alarms, and **Rule Coverage** to ensure traceable compliance.

4️⃣ A Streamlit chat UI supports **multi-turn refinement**

Users can say “Add a 5-second pump startup delay” and the AI updates logic securely.

5️⃣ Generated logic can be validated in a simulator

Allowing  **closed-loop improvement** , similar to reinforcement learning.

**The value**

* Lower onboarding/training cost
* Faster automation deployment
* Enforced safety and operation governance
* Empower workforce to collaborate with AI

**In short**

> We turn domain knowledge + natural language →
>
> **Safe, auditable, production-ready control logic** , in minutes.
